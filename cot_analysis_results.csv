However, the average heart rate of 69.1 bpm falls within a normal range, suggesting stable cardiovascular function. While the length of stay raises concerns, the heart rate indicates that the patient's heart is not under distress. Therefore, the overall assessment is inconclusive without additional clinical context, leading to uncertainty about the patient's risk level.",0,baseline,4,4,3

However, an average heart rate of 69.1 bpm is within the normal range for adults, suggesting that the patient's cardiovascular status might be stable. Considering these factors, it is difficult to definitively assess the overall risk without additional clinical context.",0,cot_short,4,4,3

The average heart rate of 69.1 bpm does not exceed the threshold of 10 days, but since the ICU stay alone is enough to classify the patient as high risk, we can conclude that the patient is at high risk based on the length of stay.

Additionally, the average heart rate of 69.1 bpm does not exceed the 10-day threshold mentioned for high risk. Therefore, based on the criteria provided, the patient is considered at low risk due to the extended ICU stay and a stable heart rate.",0,cot_bad,4,4,3
